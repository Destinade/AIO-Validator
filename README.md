# AIO Validator
AIO HTML Validator
Option 1 - Local program: similar to the current HTML validator.
Option 2 - VS Code extension: similar to the HTML entity extension I shared last week.
Option 3 - Chrome extension.

Use cases:
On top of all the HTML Validator checks+
4 hours  = Checks if there are unused scripts.
***Priority*** 6 hours  = Checks if non-converted HTML entities are in markup.
4 hours  = Checks if the document follows best practices (filenames etc.)
12 hours = Crosschecks consistency errors against the word manuscript file and markup (italic and bold words etc.)
8 hours  = Checks if all images are sized appropriately.
2 hours  = Checks heading hierarchy (Avoids the media player issue)

8 hours = GUI (if needed)
Total: 44 hours. 9 business days. 2 weeks (full-time).
44 hours / 2 hours per day = 22 days.
