# AIO HTML Validator

Option 1 - Local program: similar to the current HTML validator.<br>
Option 2 - VS Code extension: similar to the HTML entity extension I shared last week.<br>
Option 3 - Chrome extension.<br>

## Use Cases

### In development:

On top of all the HTML Validator checks+<br>
4 hours = Checks if the document follows best practices (filenames etc.)<br>
12 hours = Crosschecks consistency errors against the word manuscript file and markup (italic and bold words etc.)<br>
8 hours = Checks if all images are sized appropriately.<br>
2 hours = Checks heading hierarchy (Avoids the media player issue)<br>

### Completed:

**_Priority_** 6 hours = Checks if non-converted HTML entities are in markup.<br>
4 hours = Checks if there are unused scripts.<br>

## Total Time Needed:

8 hours = GUI (if needed)<br>
Total: 44 hours. 9 business days. 2 weeks (full-time).<br>
44 hours / 2 hours per day = 22 days.<br>
