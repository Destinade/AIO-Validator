            <p>When you want to show possession or ownership, follow these rules for <dfn>apostrophes</dfn> (’):
            </p>
            <p>For singular nouns (including those ending in <em>s</em>), add apostrophe + <em>s</em>.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>my sister’s car</em> means “the car belonging to my sister”</p>
            <p>For plural nouns ending in <em>s</em>, add only an apostrophe.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>my sisters’</em> car means “the car belonging to several of my
                sisters”</p>
            <p>For plural nouns not ending in <em>s</em>, add apostrophe + <em>s</em>.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>the women’s car</em> means “the car belonging to several women”</p>
            <p>For two or more nouns that own something together, make only the last noun possessive.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>my brother and sister’s car</em> means “the car belonging to my brother
                and sister”</p>
            <p>For two or more nouns that each owns something separately, make each of the nouns possessive.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em>my brother’s and sister’s cars</em> means “the car that belongs to
                my brother and the car that belongs to my sister”</p>
